## Quick Start
The application is based on Java 17 and uses Gradle build system.

To build Bingo Ticket Generator from source, use the following command in the main directory:

    ./gradlew clean build

You can run it like this:

    ./gradlew run

To run performance tests:

    ./gradlew jmh


## Performance tests results
Java Microbenchmark Harness (JMH) was used to test the application's performance in generating Bingo strips. The test results indicate that the application can generate around 50,000 bingo strips in one second on the MacBook Pro with i7 CPU.
